# Belarusian keyboard flag for Linux Mint

The simple script to change the icon of belarusian keyboard layout into the national one in the system tray.

Attention! This script was tested on Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon. And I suppose it can work with actual Linux Mint distros too.
If it works fine on your system, let me know. I will appreciate it=)
